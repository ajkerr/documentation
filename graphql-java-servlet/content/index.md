Implementation of GraphQL Java Servlet including support for Relay.js, Apollo and OSGi out of the box.
This project wraps the Java implementation of GraphQL provided by [GraphQL Java](https://www.graphql-java.com).
The documentation on this site focuses around the usage of the servlet. Although some parts may dive deeper
into the aspects of GraphQL Java as well, make sure to look at the 
[GraphQL Java documentation](https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/latest/) for more in depth details
regarding GraphQL Java itself. 

We try to stay up to date with GraphQL Java as much as possible. The current version supports **GraphQL Java 11.0**.
 
This project requires at least Java 8.
